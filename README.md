# Student Calculator
This repository hosts a student points calculator application.  
It reads homework and exam scores and computes final grades (by average or by median) and displays formatted results.

**Basic student points calculation formula**

- Final (avg) = 0.4 * (average of homework scores) + 0.6 * (exam score)
- Final (med) = 0.4 * (median of homework scores) + 0.6 * (exam score)

Subproject `v0.1` contains the initial working implementation (C++): reading from keyboard, random generation, reading from `Students.txt`, sorting, and formatted output.

# Execute
./StudentCalculator
